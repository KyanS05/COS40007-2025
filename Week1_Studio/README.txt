Course: COS40007 – Artificial Intelligence for Engineering Projects
Author: Alvin Phan (KyanS05) – 104480130
Week: 1

Learning Aim:
The main goal for this week is to establish a strong development environment for machine learning and data analysis projects using Python. This includes installing the required dependencies, setting up an IDE, and developing a foundational understanding of how to use core tools for AI/ML work.

By the end of this studio:
-Have Python successfully installed and configured
-Set up a virtual environment
-Install essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and more
-Choose and install a suitable IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter)
-Understand the basics of navigating and writing code in Python
-See Studio 1 PDF for full setup instructions and step-by-step breakdown.

Order of operation:
1. Test.py
2. Tut1.py
3. Tut1.2.py
4. Tut1.3.py
